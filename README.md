# üè¶ Banking Management System

A simple, secure, and responsive web application built with **PHP** and **MySQL** for managing user accounts and facilitating secure fund transfers. Designed with separate **Admin** and **User** roles to demonstrate core banking functionalities.

---

## ‚ú® Features

This system provides a full suite of banking simulation features, ensuring a clean separation between administrative controls and user operations.

### Security & Roles
- **Role-Based Access:** Dedicated dashboards for Administrators and regular Users.
- **Secure Authentication:** Secure login and session management across the application.
- **Database Transactions (ACID):** Fund transfers are wrapped in database transactions to guarantee money is either successfully debited and credited, or rolled back completely in case of failure.

### Administrative Features (`admin_dashboard.php`)
- **User Management:** Add new users to the system (`add_user.php`).
- **View All Users:** Display a list of all accounts and their current balances (`users.php`).
- **Global History:** View a complete, chronological history of all transactions across all users (`history.php`).
- **Admin Transfers:** Ability to transfer money between any two accounts.

### User Features (`user_dashboard.php`)
- **Profile Management:** View and update personal profile details and check current account balance (`profile.php`).
- **Fund Transfer:** Easily transfer money to any other registered user (`transfer.php`).
- **Personal History:** View a filtered list of only their own incoming and outgoing transactions (`user_history.php`).

### UI/UX
- **Modern Design:** Clean, centered card layout with responsive styling for all screen sizes (managed via `styles.css`).
- **Modular Code:** Consistent header and footer implementation using `footer.php`.
